  / HI THERE! I'M KRISTA.
  /
  / I live in San Francisco, where I help individuals, small businesses, and early-stage startups build their web presence.
  /
  / I left my full-time job mid-2015 to focus on the thing that makes me happiest: helping people share their passions. Despite the fact that I was working on extracurricular projects during weekends and late at night, I always thought that the number of "hats" I've worn in my seven-year career startup had left me without the specialty or focus required to formally start my own company. Turns out, I was wrong - and I'm grateful to have incredible variety built into my current workload!
  /
  / I was honored to be featured on CloudPeeps' list of '10 Freelancers to Watch', Daily Muse's list of 'The 35 Best Personal Websites We've Ever Seen' and as the subject of a Pinterview by Pinterest.
  /
  / When I'm not working on cool projects with inspiring people, you can catch me in a Bar Method class, coffee shop, or meticulously planning my next trip. Follow my global adventures on Trippy, where I served as an official travel Ambassador.



  / Hi! I'm Craig Morrison. I'm a Usability Consultant, UI Designer and Entrepreneur.
  / Currently, I help startup founders build great products that promote a positive user experience through my Usability Hour consultation service.
  / I'm also co-founder and President of Minoe, a Mom based local productivity network.
  / When I'm not doing those things, I'm also breaking world records on my web comedy web series The Record Collection.
  / I hold multiple records, including The Longest High Five and Longest Time Underwater Using A Vuvuzela To Breathe.




  / My interest in web development stemmed from my passion for gaming. Between developing websites and playing video games, I admittedly spend most of my time in front of a screen. Some of my passions are writing clean code, creating sexy user experiences and filling up a fresh cup of coffee.
